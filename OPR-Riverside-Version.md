# OPR - Riverside Version

## Starting a Game
### Placing Objectives
After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield. The players roll-off and the winner picks who places the first objective marker. Then the players alternate in placing one marker each outside of the deployment zones and over 9” away from other markers. *Note that markers can’t be placed in unreachable position, like impassable terrain.*
### Choosing Deployment Zone and Activation Order
The players roll-off and the winner chooses either the deployment zone their army deploys on or who activates first, the loser chooses the other.

### Round Phases
The game consist of 4 Rounds with phases in this order:
* Round Start
* Normal Deployment *(Turn 1 only)*
* Scout Deployment *(Turn 1 only)*
* Ambush Deployment *(Turns 2-4 only)*
* Activations
* Round End

### Deployment
On round one there are 2 deployment phases, Normal Deployment and Scout Deployment. On rounds 2-4 there is the Ambush Deployment phase.

The player that will activate first in each round deploys the first unit during each phase. Players alternate deploying units during each phase until all units have been deployed.

Units are deployed by placing them inside the boundaries of their commander’s deployment zone.

**Scout**

Units with Scout may be deployed during Scout Deployment and inside 12” outside of the commander’s deployment zone.*

**Ambush**

Units with Ambush may be deployed during the Ambush phase of rounds 2-4. It may be deployed anywhere over 9” away from enemy units.

Units deployed on Round 4 may not contest objective markers.

## Replacements and Modifiers
Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, first apply any replacement effects in the order you choose and then apply the modifier.

No matter the modifiers, a natural roll of 1 is always a failure and a natural roll of 6 is always a success.

*Example 1: A model with Quality 5+ and Good Shot fires a Reliable weapon at a unit with Stealth applied. The Quality 5 sets the success at 5+. Replacement effects are then applied: Good shot replaces this to 4+, then Reliable replaces this to 2+. Now Modifiers are applied and Stealth changes success to 3+.*

*Example 2: A weapon with AP 4 hit a Def 4 model. Defense 4 sets the success at 5+. Modifiers are then applied setting the success to 9+. Only a natural roll of 6 can succeed.*

## Shooty, Extra Shooty, and Shock
If a player rolls a six while making a ranged attack on a unit that has shooty (or extra shooty) and shock the original attack roll is not counted twice.

*Example: An Orc Leader with the trait Gun Freak (granting it Shooty: When shooting, hits from unmodified rolls of 6 are multiplied by 2 (only the original hit counts as a 6)) is equipped with a Shock Gun (Shock: Unmodified rolls of 6 are multiplied by 3 (only the original hit counts as a 6)). While making a ranged attack the model rolls a 6. The attack generates one hit for the initial roll, one additional hit with Shooty, and two additional hits for Shock, bringing the total hits to four.*

## Measuring
“Within”

## Movement
### Unit Cohesion
Units are groups of 1 or more models that activate and defend together. Models in a unit must deploy and move together, maintaining Unit Cohesion when given a choice by the Unit’s commander.

Unit Cohesion means:
- All models in the unit must stay within 1” of another model in the unit, *and*
- All models in the unit must stay within a 9” diameter or as close as possible.

If Unit Cohesion is broken for a Unit, it must be moved back into Unit Cohesion by that Unit’s commander the next time they have the option of moving the unit.

### 1” Spacing

Models from a unit may not move or be deployed within 1” of a model of another unit unless:
- That other unit is the target of their Charge, *or*
- The other unit is the Transport they are Embarking into


## Line of Sight (LoS)
When playing the game, Line of Sight is used to determine if a model can see another model for any purpose.

To determine if a model has LoS on a second model, see if at least 10% of the second model is visible from the center of the first model. Using the second model’s base is the best way to do this, but in cases the base is obscured fallback to considering if at least 10% of the second model’s main body is visible to the first model (disregard appendages, horns, flags, antennae, etc).

Notes on Line of Sight:
- Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the miniature is actually facing.
- Models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit for the purpose of line of sight.
- Models always have line of sight to themselves, and may target themselves (unless stated otherwise).
- Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other units, friendly or enemy. However, Models with Tough 6+ can see and be seen over models with less than Tough 6. *For Heroes, use Tough 12+ instead of Tough 6+.*
