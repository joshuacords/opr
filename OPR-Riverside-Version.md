# OPR - Riverside Version

## Starting a Game
### Placing Objectives
After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield. The commanders roll-off and the winner picks who places the first objective marker. Then the commanders alternate in placing one marker each outside of the deployment zones and over 9” away from other markers. *Note that markers can’t be placed in unreachable position, like impassable terrain.*

### Choosing Deployment Zone and Activation Order
The commanders roll-off and the winner chooses either the Deployment Zone their army deploys on or who activates first, the loser chooses the other.

### Round Phases
The game consist of 4 Rounds with phases in this order:
* Beginning Phase
* Deployment Phases
** Normal Deployment *(Turn 1 only)*
** Scout Deployment *(Turn 1 only)*
** Ambush Deployment *(Turns 2-4 only)*
* Activation Phase
* End Phase

### Beginning Phase
At the start of each Round Casters receive spell tokens and units are not longer Fatigued.

### Deployment Phase
On round one there are 2 deployment phases, Normal Deployment and Scout Deployment. On rounds 2-4 there is the Ambush Deployment phase.

The commander that will activate first in each round deploys the first unit during each phase. Commanders alternate deploying units during each phase until all units have been deployed.

Units are deployed by placing them inside the boundaries of their commander’s Deployment Zone.

#### Scout Deployment
The Scout Deployment Zone is 12" beyond the boundaries of the commander's Deployment Zone.

Units with Scout may be deployed during the Scout Deployment phase during which they use the commander’s Scout Deployment Zone.

#### Ambush Deployment
Units with Ambush may be deployed during the Ambush phase of rounds 2-4, during which they may be deployed anywhere over 9” away from enemy units.

Units deployed on Round 4 may not contest objective markers.

## End Phase
At the end of each turn if a commander has a non-Shaken unit within 3" of an objective then that commander now controls the objective. If multiple commanders have non-Shaken units within 3" of an objective,  the objective returns to neutral control.

Leaving an objective does not stop them from being controlled.

**After the end of Round 4, the commander controlling the most objectives wins.**

## Activation Phase
During the Activation Phase, commanders alternate Activating their Units until all their Units have been activated for the Round. After Round 1, start with the commander that finished their activations first last round.

### Activation Actions
To Activate a Unit have that Unit take an Action.
- **Hold**: Doesn't move; uses Ranged Attack.
- **Advance**: Moves 6"; uses Ranged Attack.
- **Rush**: Moves 12"; no attacks.
- **Charge**: Moves 12" into a Melee Attack.
- **Idle**: Remove **Shaken**.

#### Hold Action
When taking a Hold Action, the models in the unit may not move. The unit may use a Ranged Attack.

#### Advance Action
When taking an Advance Action, all models in the unit may move by up to 6”. After moving the unit may use a Ranged Attack.

#### Rush Action
When taking an Rush Action, all models in the unit may move by up to 12”.

#### Charge Action
When taking a Charge Action the unit chooses an enemy unit to target with a Melee Attack. All models in the unit must move by up to 12” to get in base contact with the target, or as close as possible. At least 1 model in the unit must be able to make contact with the target unit to Charge.

#### Idle Action
When taking the Idle Action remove the Shaken condition. The unit may not use any Special Abilities.

#### Special Abilities
Special Abilities such as the casting of a Spell may be used during an Activation Action. They may be used before or after moving and in any order, but must be used before a Ranged or Melee Attack is made.

## Measuring
Distances are usually measured from a model’s base, however if a model has no base, then all distances are measured from
the edges of the model's main body.

When measuring the distance between two models you always measure from/to the closest point of their bases.
When measuring the distance between two units you always measure from/to the closest model in each unit.

When measuring how far a model moves always measure so that no part of its base moves further than the total distance.

## Movement
- Bases may not overlap or stack.
- 1" Spacing must be maintained throughout the movement path.
- When measuring movement around corners, you may consider your unit as a point.
- When passing between 2 objects, the model must be able to fit and maintain 1" Spacing.

### 1” Spacing
Models from a unit may not move or be deployed within 1” of a model of another unit unless:
- That other unit is the target of their Charge, *or*
- The other unit is the Transport they are Embarking into

### Unit Cohesion
- All models in the unit must stay within 1” of another model in the unit, *and*
- All models in the unit must stay within a 9” diameter or as close as possible.

Given the choice, commanders must maintain Unit Cohesion.

If Unit Cohesion is broken for a Unit, it must be moved back into Unit Cohesion by that Unit’s commander the next time they have the option to move the unit.

## Line of Sight (LoS)
When playing the game, Line of Sight is used to determine if a model can see another model for any purpose.

To determine if a model has LoS on a second model, see if at least 10% of the second model is visible from the center of the first model. Using the second model’s base is the best way to do this, but in cases the base is obscured fallback to considering if at least 10% of the second model’s main body is visible to the first model (disregard appendages, horns, flags, antennae, etc).

Notes on Line of Sight:
- Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the miniature is actually facing.
- Models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit for the purpose of LoS.
- Models have LoS to themselves, and may target themselves.
- Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other units, friendly or enemy. However, **Large Models** can see and be seen over **Small Models**.

## Ranged Attacks
1. Choose Targets
2. Determine Cover
3. Resolve Attacks
4. Morale Test

### Choose Targets
Choose one target for each ranged weapon type the unit has. A maximum of 2 different targets may be chosen.

All models with LoS and with ranged weapons in range of their target may attack with those weapons.

### Determine Cover
For each model, if more than half of the targeted unit is not in LoS, or in the case of single model units - more than half of the unit is hidden, that target has **Cover** from the model's attack.

### Resolve Attacks
See **Resolving Attacks**.

### Morale Test
See **Morale Test**.

## Melee Attacks
1. Movement
2. Determine Attacks
3. Resolve Attacks
4. Return Strikes
4. Morale Test

### Movement
Once all models in the Charging unit have moved, all models in the targeted unit that are not in base contact with it must move by up to 3" to get into base contact or as close as possible.

### Determine Attacks
All models in the Charging unit within 2" of the targeted enemy attack with their melee weapons.

### Resolve Attacks
See **Resolving Attacks**.

### Return Strikes
The defending unit may choose to strike back. If so, all defending models within 2" of the Charging unit attack with their melee weapons. Resolve their attacks: **Resolving Attacks**.

### Morale Test
Units in melee don’t take morale tests from wounds, instead compare the number of wounds each unit caused. The unit with the lowest total loses, and must take a **Morale Test** unless the opposing unit was destroyed.

Results of the Morale Test
- *Success*: nothing happens.
- *Failure*: If half or less of the models in a unit remain from the amount it started the game with, or with a single model unit - if it has taken at least half of its Tough value in wounds, the unit **Routs** and is removed from the game, otherwise the unit is **Shaken**.

#### Fatigue
After attacking with a melee weapon by Charging or striking back, a unit is Fatigued and their melee attacks only succeed on rolls of 6 for the rest of the round.

## Resolving Attacks

### Roll Attacks
For each target unit, roll all weapon attacks against that unit. Use the weapon's model's Quality for the base difficulty. Each successful roll counts as a Hit.

### Roll Defense
For every Hit, the targeted unit rolls a die to defend, using its Defense for the base difficulty. A success discards the Hit, a failure causes 1 Wound to the target.

### Remove Casualties
After all defense rolls have been made, the defending player chooses which models to assign wounds to following this order:
1. Non-tough Units
2. Tough Units with Wounds
3. Tough Units without Wounds
4. Hero Units

A model may not be assigned more than 1 wound or if it has Tough, more wounds than its Tough value. Once it has been assigned its maximum wounds it is removed as a Casualty.

## Morale Tests
Whenever a unit takes a wound from a spell, ability, or after Resolving Attacks outside a Charge Action, a Morale Test may be necessary.

Abilities that trigger or activate as part of an attack (ie: Impact, Take Down) apply their wounds during that attack's resolution and do not trigger a separate Morale Test.

If half or less of the models in a unit remain from the amount it started the game with, or for a single model unit - if it has taken at least half of its Tough value in wounds, the unit takes a **Morale Test**. If the test fails, the unit is **Shaken**.

To take a Morale Test, the unit rolls a Quality Test. **Shaken** units always fail Morale Tests.

## Rolling Dice
Attacking, Morale Tests, and other checks use dice to determine their success or failure.

When rolling, the die roll is successful  if the die result is greater than or equals the difficulty.  

To determine the difficulty, start with the base difficulty. Then apply any replacement effects in the order you choose. Last apply any modifiers.

Modifiers lower the difficulty of the die roll. *For example, a unit has Defense 4 giving the roll a base difficulty of 4+. But the unit also has Cover applying +1 to Defense. The difficulty is now 3+ and a die result of 3 would successfully defend.*

No matter the modifiers, a roll of 1 is always a failure and a roll of 6 is always a success.

*Example 1: A model with Quality 5 and Good Shot fires a Reliable weapon at a unit with Stealth applied. The Quality 5 sets the success at 5+. Replacement effects are then applied: Good shot replaces this to 4+, then Reliable replaces this to 2+. Now Modifiers are applied and Stealth changes success to 3+.*

*Example 2: A weapon with AP 4 hit a Def 4 model. Defense 4 sets the difficulty at 5+. Modifiers are then applied setting the difficulty to 9+. Only a natural roll of 6 can succeed.*

### Critical Hit Abilities
#### Critical Hit
Rolls of 6. If an ability extends Critical Hits to 5, that roll must succeed to trigger Critical Hit Effects.

#### Bonus Hit
A bonus hit is an automatic hit that’s a copy of the hit that generated it except it can’t Critically Hit and never has any Critical Hit effects.

### Furious
Whenever a model with Furious rolls a **Critical Hit** during its Charge Action, that weapon generates 1 **Bonus Hit**.

### Rending
Regeneration rolls against wounds from this weapon have -1.

When this weapon rolls a **Critical Hit**, that hit has AP(4). *Note: This effect does not apply to Bonus Hits.*

### Shooty
Whenever a model with Shooty rolls a  **Critical Hit** with a ranged weapon, that weapon generates 1 **Bonus Hit**.

### Extra Shooty
This model and its unit have Shooty. If they already had Shooty, Shooty now Critically Hits on a 5 or 6.

### Blast[X]
Weapons with Blast ignore cover. Multiply each hit by X or by the number of models in the target unit, whichever is less.

Multiplied hits have the same AP and Special Effects as the original, including those triggered by **Critical Hits**.

Bonus Hits do copy Blast.

### Shooty and Shock
If a commander rolls a six while making a ranged attack on a unit that has Shooty and Shock the multiples are not chained and would be better worded as "generates an additional attack" or "generates 2 additional attacks".

*Example: An Orc Leader with the trait Gun Freak (granting it Shooty: When shooting, hits from unmodified rolls of 6 are multiplied by 2 (only the original hit counts as a 6)) is equipped with a Shock Gun (Shock: Unmodified rolls of 6 are multiplied by 3 (only the original hit counts as a 6)). While making a ranged attack the model rolls a 6. The attack generates one hit for the initial roll, one additional hit with Shooty, and two additional hits for Shock, bringing the total hits to four.*

## Terrain
Each piece of terrain may count as having multiple terrain types, and you may also add other conditions to further customize your terrain rules.

### Terrain Types
#### Open Terrain
Any surface not specifically defined. Open terrain has no special rules.

#### Cover Terrain
If more than half of the models of a unit are in or behind Cover Terrain, or in the case of single model units - if more than half of the unit's base is within or behind Cover Terrain, that unit has **Cover**.

#### Dangerous Terrain
If a model moves in or through Dangerous Terrain with a Rush or Charge Action, then it takes a dangerous terrain test.

To take a dangerous terrain test, roll one die, and if the result is 1 the unit takes one automatic wound.

If there are models with the Tough(X) rule in the unit, then you must roll X dice instead of 1 die.

#### Difficult Terrain
If any model in a unit moves in or through difficult terrain at any point of its move, then all models in the unit may not move more than 6” for that movement.

#### Elevated Terrain
Models using a Ranged Attack from Elevated Terrain higher than their target gain a bonus. They may consider LoS Blocking Terrain as only giving Cover to their target, **or** they may ignore Cover granted to their target by Terrain.

#### Impassable Terrain
Units may not move through impassable terrain.

#### LoS Blocking Terrain
Units may not draw Line of Sight through LoS Blocking Terrain.

### Terrain Grouping
#### Barricade
Difficult Terrain for **Large models**. Cover Terrain for units behind the Barricade when over 1" from Barricade.

#### Forest
Cover Terrain. LoS Blocking terrain for units behind the Forest.

#### Forest Wall
LoS Blocking terrain for units behind the Forest Wall. Units cannot be within the Forest Wall.

#### Lakes
Dangerous Terrain.

#### Hills
Elevated Terrain for models on top. Cover Terrain for models behind.

#### Ramps
Difficult Terrain.

#### Ruins
Cover Terrain. Difficult Terrain.

### Terrain Movement
Units may climb terrain up to 3" tall as part of its movement. Measure the distance vertically.

Models may not end their movement on unstable terrain such as Barricades.

## Terms
#### Cover
Units with Cover get +1 to Defense against Ranged weapons. Cover does not stack.

#### Fatigued
When using melee weapons, fatigued units only hit on a roll of 6. Fatigue is removed at the Beginning of each Round.

#### Infantry
Models with no Tough or Heroes with up to Tough 3.

#### Move
Only when a model is moved may it change its position and orientation.

#### Large Model
Model with Tough (6) and greater, or Hero with greater than Tough (6).

#### Shaken
Shaken units count as being Fatigued, and automatically fail Morale Tests as long as they are Shaken. They cannot contest objectives.

#### Small Model
Model with less than Tough (6), or Hero with Tough (6) or less.

#### Unit
Units are groups of 1 or more models that activate and defend together. Models in a unit must deploy and move together, maintaining Unit Cohesion when given a choice by the Unit’s commander.

## Special Rules
#### Flying
Models with this special rule may move through units and terrain, and may ignore terrain effects when moving. When measuring ignore elevation changes and measure as if the board was flat.

#### Teleport
Once per activation, before attack, place this unit anywhere within 6". This may be used during the unit's movement.
