# OPR - Riverside Version

## Starting a Game
### Placing Objectives
After the table has been prepared, you and your opponent must set up D3+2 objective markers on the battlefield. The commanders roll-off and the winner picks who places the first objective marker. Then the commanders alternate in placing one marker each outside of the deployment zones and over 9” away from other markers. *Note that markers can’t be placed in unreachable position, like impassable terrain.*

### Choosing Deployment Zone and Activation Order
The commanders roll-off and the winner chooses either the Deployment Zone their army deploys on or who activates first, the loser chooses the other.

### Round Phases
The game consist of 4 Rounds with phases in this order:
* Round Start
* Normal Deployment *(Turn 1 only)*
* Scout Deployment *(Turn 1 only)*
* Ambush Deployment *(Turns 2-4 only)*
* Activations
* Round End

### Deployment Phase
On round one there are 2 deployment phases, Normal Deployment and Scout Deployment. On rounds 2-4 there is the Ambush Deployment phase.

The commander that will activate first in each round deploys the first unit during each phase. commanders alternate deploying units during each phase until all units have been deployed.

Units are deployed by placing them inside the boundaries of their commander’s Deployment Zone.

**Scout Deployment**

The Scout Deployment Zone is 12" beyond the boundaries of the commander's Deployment Zone.

Units with Scout may be deployed during the Scout Deployment phase during which they use the commander’s Scout Deployment Zone.


**Ambush Deployment**

Units with Ambush may be deployed during the Ambush phase of rounds 2-4, during which they may be deployed anywhere over 9” away from enemy units.

Units deployed on Round 4 may not contest objective markers.

## Replacements and Modifiers
Whenever a modifier applies to one of your rolls, first apply any replacement effects in the order you choose and then apply the modifier.

No matter the modifiers, a natural roll of 1 is always a failure and a natural roll of 6 is always a success.

*Example 1: A model with Quality 5+ and Good Shot fires a Reliable weapon at a unit with Stealth applied. The Quality 5 sets the success at 5+. Replacement effects are then applied: Good shot replaces this to 4+, then Reliable replaces this to 2+. Now Modifiers are applied and Stealth changes success to 3+.*

*Example 2: A weapon with AP 4 hit a Def 4 model. Defense 4 sets the success at 5+. Modifiers are then applied setting the success to 9+. Only a natural roll of 6 can succeed.*

## Activation Phase

During the Activation Phase, commanders alternate Activating their Units until all their Units have been activated for the Round. After Round 1, start with the commander that finished their activations first last round.

### Activation Actions

To Activate a Unit have that Unit take an Action.

- **Hold**: Doesn't move; uses Ranged Attack.
- **Advance**: Moves 6"; uses Ranged Attack.
- **Rush**: Moves 12"; no attacks.
- **Charge**: Moves 12" into a Melee Attack.
- **Idle**: Remove **Shaken**.

#### Hold Action
When taking a Hold Action, the models in the unit may not move. The unit may use a Ranged Attack.

#### Advance Action
When taking an Advance Action, all models in the unit may move by up to 6”. After moving the unit may use a Ranged Attack.

#### Rush Action
When taking an Rush Action, all models in the unit may move by up to 12”.

#### Charge Action
When taking a Charge Action the unit chooses an enemy target to Melee Attack. All models in the unit may move by up to 12”, but at least 1 model in the unit must make contact with the target.

#### Idle Action
When taking the Idle Action remove the Shaken condition. The unit may not use any Special Abilities.

#### Special Abilities
Special Abilities such as casting of a Spell may be used during an Action. They maybe used before or after moving and in any order, but must be used before a Ranged or Melee Attack is made.

## Ranged Attacks

1. Choose Targets
2. Determine Cover
3. Roll Attacks
4. Roll Defense
5. Remove Casualties
6. Morale Check

### Choose Targets
Choose one target for each ranged weapon type the unit has. A maximum of 2 different targets may be chosen.

All models with LoS and in range of their target may fire.

### Determine Cover
For each model, if more than half of the targeted unit is not in LoS, or in the case of single model units - more than half of the unit is hidden, that target has **Cover** from the model's attack.

### Roll Attacks
For each target unit, roll all attacks of models firing on that unit. Use the model's Quality for the base difficulty. Each successful roll counts as a Hit.

### Roll Defense
For every Hit, the targeted unit rolls a die to defend, using its Defense for the base difficulty. A success discards the Hit, a failure causes 1 Wound to the target.

### Remove Casualties
After all defense rolls have been made, the defending player chooses which models to assign wounds to following this order:
1. Non-tough Units
2. Tough Units with Wounds
3. Tough Units without Wounds
4. Hero Units

A model may not be assigned more than 1 wound or if it has Tough, more wounds than its Tough value. Once it has been assigned its maximum wounds it is removed as a Casualty.

### Morale Check
If half or less of the models in a unit remain from the amount it started the game with, or with a single model unit - if it has taken at least half of its Tough value in wounds, the unit takes a **Morale Test**. If the test fails, the unit is **Shaken**.


## Rolling Attacks

## Critical Hit Abilities

### Furious

Whenever a model with Furious rolls a **Critical Hit** during its Charge Action, generate 1 **Bonus Hit** with that weapon.

### Rending

Units taking hits from weapons with Rending get -1 to Regeneration rolls.

Whenever a Rending weapon rolls a **Critical Hit**, that hit has AP(4). *Note: This effect does not apply to Bonus Hits.*

### Shooty

Whenever a model with Shooty rolls a  **Critical Hit** with a ranged weapon, generate 1 **Bonus Hit** with that weapon.

### Extra Shooty

This model and its unit have Shooty. If they already had Shooty, Shooty now Critically Hits on a 5 or 6.

### Blast[X]

Weapons with Blast ignore cover. Multiply each hit by X or by the number of models in the target unit, whichever is less. Multiplied hits have the same AP and Special Effects as the original, including those triggered by **Critical Hits**.

### Shooty and Shock
If a commander rolls a six while making a ranged attack on a unit that has Shooty and Shock the multiples are not chained and would be better worded as "generates an additional attack" or "generates 2 additional attacks".

*Example: An Orc Leader with the trait Gun Freak (granting it Shooty: When shooting, hits from unmodified rolls of 6 are multiplied by 2 (only the original hit counts as a 6)) is equipped with a Shock Gun (Shock: Unmodified rolls of 6 are multiplied by 3 (only the original hit counts as a 6)). While making a ranged attack the model rolls a 6. The attack generates one hit for the initial roll, one additional hit with Shooty, and two additional hits for Shock, bringing the total hits to four.*

## Measuring
“Within”

## Movement

- Bases may not overlap or stack.
- 1" Spacing must be maintained throughout the movement path.
- When measuring movement around corners, you may consider your unit as a point.
- When passing between 2 objects, the model must be able to fit and maintain 1" Spacing.

### 1” Spacing

Models from a unit may not move or be deployed within 1” of a model of another unit unless:
- That other unit is the target of their Charge, *or*
- The other unit is the Transport they are Embarking into

### Unit Cohesion
- All models in the unit must stay within 1” of another model in the unit, *and*
- All models in the unit must stay within a 9” diameter or as close as possible.

Given the choice, commanders must maintain Unit Cohesion.

If Unit Cohesion is broken for a Unit, it must be moved back into Unit Cohesion by that Unit’s commander the next time they have the option to move the unit.


## Line of Sight (LoS)
When playing the game, Line of Sight is used to determine if a model can see another model for any purpose.

To determine if a model has LoS on a second model, see if at least 10% of the second model is visible from the center of the first model. Using the second model’s base is the best way to do this, but in cases the base is obscured fallback to considering if at least 10% of the second model’s main body is visible to the first model (disregard appendages, horns, flags, antennae, etc).

Notes on Line of Sight:
- Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the miniature is actually facing.
- Models may always ignore friendly models from their own unit for the purpose of line of sight.
- Models always have line of sight to themselves, and may target themselves (unless stated otherwise).
- Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other units, friendly or enemy. However, **Large Models** can see and be seen over **Small Models**. *For Heroes, use Tough 12+ instead of Tough 6+.*
