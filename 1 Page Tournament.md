## Mission
### Objectives
At the end of each round, if a unit is within 3” of a marker while enemies aren’t, then it’s seized, and remains seized even after leaving. Shaken units can’t seize markers, and if units from both sides are contesting a marker, then it becomes neutral again.

The game ends after 4 rounds, and the
player that controls most markers wins.

### Deployment and Activations
The commanders roll-off and the winner chooses either the Deployment Zone their army deploys on or who activates first, the loser chooses the other.

The commander that will activate first in each round deploys the first unit during each phase. Commanders alternate deploying units during each phase until all units have been deployed.

### Playing the Game
The game is played in rounds, with
players alternating in activating one unit
each. After Round 1, start with the commander that finished their activations first last round.

### Activation Actions
- **Hold**: Doesn't move; uses Ranged Attack.
- **Advance**: Moves 6"; uses Ranged Attack.
- **Rush**: Moves 12"; no attacks.
- **Charge**: Moves 12" into a Melee Attack. At least 1 model in the unit must be able to make base contact with the target unit to Charge.
- **Idle**: Remove **Shaken**, no other Abilities.

Special Abilities such as the casting of a Spell may be used during an Activation Action. They may be used before or after moving and in any order, but must be used before a Ranged or Melee Attack is made.

### Movement
- Unit members must stay within 1” of at
least one other member, and within 9” of
all other members.
- 1" Spacing from other units must be maintained throughout the movement path.
- When measuring movement around corners, you may consider your unit as a point.
- When passing between 2 objects, the model must be able to fit and maintain 1" Spacing.

### Line of Sight (LoS)
To determine if a model has LoS on a second model, see if at least 10% of the second model is visible from the center of the first model.

- Models can always see in all directions, regardless of where the miniature is actually facing.
- Models ignore friendly models from their own unit for the purpose of LoS.
- Models have LoS to themselves, and may target themselves.
- Models may not see through solid obstacles, including the perimeter of other units, friendly or enemy. However, **Large Models** can see and be seen over **Small Models**.

### Ranged Attack
1. Choose Targets
2. Determine Cover
3. Resolve Attacks
4. Morale Test

Models in range and LoS may fire all ranged weapons, and may fire at up to two different targets with different weapon types.

For each model, if more than half of the targeted unit is not in LoS, that target has **Cover** from the model's attack.

Shooting models take one quality test per attack, and each success is a hit. For each hit defending units roll one die trying to score their Defense value or higher, and each fail causes one wound. For each wound, the defender must remove one model.

### Melee Attacks
1. Movement
2. Determine Attacks
3. Resolve Attacks
4. Return Strikes
5. Morale Test
6. Consolidation Moves

Charging models must move into base contact with the target, or as close as possible, and then defenders must do the same by moving up to 3”. Models within 2” of enemies may strike with all their melee weapons. Remove Casualties.

The defending unit may choose to strike back. Once both units are done, the loser must take a Morale Test.
- *Success*: nothing happens.
- *Failure*: If half or less of the models of the unit's total size, the unit is removed from the game, otherwise the unit is **Shaken**.

If one of the two units is destroyed, the other may move by up to 3”, otherwise the charging unit must move back by 1”.

Fatigue: Units only hit on unmodified
results of 6 in melee until the end of the
round after they charge or strike back.

### Morale Test
Whenever a unit takes a wound from a spell, ability, or after Resolving Attacks outside a Charge Action, a Morale Test may be necessary. Abilities that trigger or activate as part of an attack (ie: Impact, Take Down) apply their wounds during that attack's resolution and do not trigger a separate Morale Test.

If half or less of the unit remains, the unit takes a **Morale Test**. If the test fails, the unit is **Shaken**. To take a Morale Test, the unit rolls a Quality Test. **Shaken** units always fail Morale Tests.

### Critical Hit
Abilities that trigger when a Critical Hit (roll of 6) is rolled can generate Bonus Hits. A bonus hit is an automatic hit that’s a copy of the original except it can’t Critically Hit and never has any Critical Hit effects. Interpret "multiplied by 2" as "generates 1 Bonus Hit".

Blast is copied by Bonus Hits, Rending's AP 4 is not.

### Terms
**Large/Small Model**: A Large Model has Tough (6) and greater, or is a Hero with greater than Tough (6), otherwise it's a Small Model.
